We The People
=============

This is project started for the [VIP Hackathon](http://viphackathon.eventbrite.com/) to
solve the problem of awareness among the general public about local elections.

Our idea centers around issues and giving an unbiased look at how every candidate involved
in the election feels about them.

#####Things to do
+ Complete candidate comparision
+ Integrate sentiment analysis
